## 💡 Philosophy: Build Performance as Documentation
In the modern web ecosystem, documentation is only as good as the developer's environment. My approach to Vite documentation focuses on **Developer Experience (DX)**—optimizing build configurations and explaining the "why" behind the HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and bundling logic to ensure engineers spend less time configuring and more time building.

## 🛠️ Technical Talent Stack

* **Core:** Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`), Plugin API, and Environment Variables.
* **Tooling:** Rollup-based bundling, ESBuild optimization, and Asset handling.
* **Workflows:** CI/CD integration, Static Site Generation (SSG), and Dev-Server performance tuning.
* **Frameworks:** Seamless integration documentation for React, Vue, and Docusaurus.

## 📐 My Documentation Standards

1.  **Zero-Config Clarity:** I document how to leverage Vite’s "out-of-the-box" features first to keep user configurations lean and maintainable.
2.  **Performance Benchmarking:** Documentation includes "Before & After" build metrics to demonstrate the tangible impact of build-tooling optimizations.
3.  **Modular Logic:** I explain configurations as modular units, making it easy for enterprise teams to scale their security and frontend architecture.
